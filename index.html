  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am a passionate and detail-oriented Civil Engineering student with a keen interest in Structural Engineering. Currently interning at Gaindakot Municipality. I have hands-on experience in designing seismic-resistant structures using ETABS and AutoCAD as my key academic project involved structural analysis of a 4-storey residential building using the Response Spectrum Method as per NBC 105: 2020, IS 1893, IS 456. Iâ€™m actively seeking opportunities to apply and grow my technical skills in the structural domain

  <h2>Key Project</h2>
  <h3>Structural Analysis and Design of a 4-Storey Residential Building</h3>
  <p>
    This project involved the complete analysis and design of a G+3 residential building located in a seismic-prone area. I used <strong>ETABS</strong> for structural modeling and performed seismic analysis using the <strong>Response Spectrum Method</strong> as per NBC 105: 2020. Structural components were designed based on IS 456:2000, and reinforcement detailing was prepared using AutoCAD.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Software Used:</strong> ETABS, AutoCAD, MS Excel</li>
    <li><strong>Codes:</strong> NBC 105: 2020,IS 456:2000, IS 1893:2016</li>
    <li><strong>Output:</strong> Structural safety verification, reinforcement detailing, and quantity estimates</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Field Exposure</h2>
  <p>
    During my academic journey, I gained practical site exposure in Gaindakot Municipality  where I observed reinforcement placing, concrete pouring, slab casting, and foundation works.I help out with things like taking field measurements, checking construction quality, estimating project costs, and keeping an eye on work going on-site. I also get to interact with the public and team members, which is helping me learn how real-world engineering projects come together. This strengthened my understanding of structural details and construction practices.
